            <p>Welcome to Salon Inspire! Below is the full handbook:</p>
            <p id="handbook-text">
               
EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY

It is the policy of Salon Inspire to provide equal employment and advancement policies without regard to an employee’s race, color, creed sex, religion, national origin, age, veteran status, marital status, status with regard to public assistance, membership of activity in a local commission of sexual orientation, or disability as defined in the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA). 

All employment-related decisions are based solely upon legitimate, job-related factors such as skill, ability, past performance, and Company needs. This policy will be carried out by the Company in a manner consistent with good business practices and procedures, and in compliance with all applicable state and federal laws.



90-DAY TRIAL PERIOD

All new hires are subject to a 90 day probationary period where it is us getting to know them and them getting to know us. We will determine if we are a good fit for each other, if we need to do additional training or if it’s best to part ways at this point.

During the 90-day trial period, a new hire is allowed 1 sick day without a doctors note. All others may be subject to Code Breaker, immediate termination or reason that offer of employment is not extended beyond 90 day probationary period. We also conduct 30/60/90-day touchbase meetings with mentors to assess progress, provide support, and gather mentor reviews. These reviews will be considered in evaluating performance and may serve as grounds for a Code Breaker designation, termination, or non-extension of employment if concerns arise regarding professionalism, conduct, or adherence to expectations. (additional info added)


IMMIGRATION ACT REQUIREMENTS

Salon Inspire adheres to the requirements of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. Accordingly, we are required to and will inspect and verify documentation that reflects the identity of every new employee. Prior to the commencement of work, we require that you complete an I-9 Form

LEVEL SYSTEMS

Our level system is determined by the demand of the service providers’ time and their ability to set, reach and maintain certain goals. Promotions are based on predetermined goals and are clarified in our career path and level system resources. 

Our level system is designed to promote growth. All stylist launching from associate to Level 1 are given 120 days to begin making commission as their source of pay. In the event that a stylist is not growing we follow this plan…
120 days after your start date, for those starting outside the associate program OR after launching to Level 1 and having a revenue setback that creates more than 2 pay periods of hourly pay and not commissioned salary- 
*additional 2 pay periods at hourly– reduce schedule by one day
*additional 2 pay periods at hourly- code breaker
REPEAT
3rd code breaker is a deal breaker(termination)
<schedule cannot be reduced to less than 2 days per week

All Stylists receiving a promotion are given a 90 day Launch Period. After 90 days if previous level jump numbers are not being maintained, the commission rate will reflect the actual service dollars being brought in. Prices to guests will not change. 


ASSOCIATE PROGRAM

Associates must be licensed or recent graduates awaiting state board examination and hold a current temporary cosmetology license.

Associates may not graduate the associate program until they can consistently display they can fill their books during 50% of their working hours.

MOONLIGHTING

We expect full-time employees to devote their entire best effort to the performance of their position with Salon Inspire. While Salon Inspire cannot dictate the use of any employee’s personal time, any other activity must not be in competition with, effect growth at or be contrary to the interests of Salon Inspire, nor interfere with the proper and efficient performance or of the employee’s duties. Such action may be a cause for disciplinary action by Salon Inspire. Building/Doing clients and doing them at home is considered moonlighting. 

In short…The Salon Owner and management have the authority to terminate an employee if she feels that too many rules and regulations have been broken. However, the employee will not be terminated without first having verbal warnings and a written warning to clarify and discuss the problem(s) unless theft is involved or within their 90-day probation period. At all times management will communicate with you when we feel your performance and job is not up to Salon Inspire’s standard.

LOSS PREVENTION

Part of loss prevention (theft) in a salon is making sure all product use is charged for. If you do not charge correctly for your services, intentionally or unintentionally, Salon Inspire and the service provider are losing money. Please measure and charge appropriately for all Clients. Not doing so will result in disciplinary action.

Another aspect of loss prevention in a salon is clock theft. When clocked in please be aware of how you spend your time. Downtime should be spent making sure that appearance is in line with expectations, business building or skill building… (business building can include writing Thank You cards, offers for services, social media posts, tracking, planning, etc.) (skill building can include watching videos/hair tutorials, playing consultation gamification, reading business building or trade magazines, retail product study)

An employee will be allowed an unpaid leave of up to fifteen(15) unpaid days in the event of death to a member of his/her immediate family without being made up. “Immediate Family”. For good cause, the Owners may extend the length of leave. Salon Inspire may also require proof of death and kinship or allow the employee to use accrued vacation when applicable.

OTHER LEAVES

Each state provides for different leave laws. Please see your Team Lead or Owner with any questions or any leaves not addressed in this Handbook.


CALL IN SICK / SICK TIME

If you wake up not feeling well or need to call in sick, please group chat the opening front desk and the scheduled shift leader. You may be asked to help reschedule clients if you are able. You can check the front desk schedule and the team shift schedule on the landing page if your not sure who's opening. See Sick Policy for sick time off. 


EMPLOYEE WORK RULES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

ATTENDANCE AND PUNCTUALITY / Weather Emergency

In order for our Salon to function efficiently, we must have all employees present for work. Daily attendance records will be maintained by the Salon. If you are going to be absent, you MUST call or text your Shift Lead & Shift Front Desk member at least two (2) hours prior to the start of your scheduled work shift. The report must be made by you directly to your Shift Leader & Front Desk on schedule; you may not rely on friends, relatives, or fellow employees to convey a message for you. If your absence is unreported for a period of two days, without good reason, the Salon will consider you have voluntarily terminated your employment.

PUNCTUALITY IS AS IMPORTANT AS ATTENDANCE…

To be punctual, stylists/service providers must have your work area ready 10 minutes before your scheduled hour of work and be ready to serve guests. If you are going to be late by more than ten (10) minutes, you should provide advance notice to your Team Lead or the front desk staff on the schedule to the anticipated length of tardiness. Regardless of that length of time you are tardy, you must immediately report to your Team Lead or front desk upon arrival. A late fee of $10.00 will apply and must be paid within 24 hours or subject to a code breaker.

Behavior prohibited by this Policy also includes requests to engage in illegal conduct or retaliation for the making of a complaint.

Sexual Harassment. One type of harassment that is expressly prohibited is sexual harassment. Sexual harassment is defined as: Unwanted sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, any other verbal, non-verbal, or physical conduct of a sexual nature when:continues…..
Submission to such conduct is a condition of keeping or obtaining employment, whether expressed in explicit or implicit terms;

Personnel decisions are based on an employee’s submission to or rejection of such conduct; or

Such conduct has the effect or purpose of creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment or otherwise substantially interfering with an individual’s employment.
